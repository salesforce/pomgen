# Examples based goldfiles

This location contains the manifest files and related files generated by poppy for the [examples](../examples) directory tree.

This makes it easier to detect fundamental changes in how manifest files are generated that may not be caught by tests.

To regenerate the goldfiles, run from the root of this repository:

```
rm -rf tests/examples_goldfiles/examples
bazel run //:gen -- --package examples --destdir tests/examples_goldfiles
```

Then use git commands to see if anything unexpected changed.
