# Metadata Files

pomgen metadata files live at `<bazel-package>/MVN-INF`.


### BUILD.pom (required)

The BUILD.pom files defines how a pom.xml (for this bazel package) should be generated.

Example:

```
maven_artifact(
    group_id = "com.pomgen.example",
    artifact_id = "juicer",
    version = "3.0.0-SNAPSHOT",
    pom_generation_mode = "dynamic",
)

maven_artifact_update(
    version_increment_strategy = "minor",
)
```

#### Required Attributes

##### maven_artifact.group_id

The `<groupId>` for the generated pom.xml.

##### maven_artifact.artifact_id

The `<artifactId>` for the generated pom.xml.

##### maven_artifact.version

The `<version>` for the generated pom.xml.

##### maven_artifact.pom_generation_mode

- dynamic:  The pom is generated based on the `BUILD` file dependencies [example](../examples/hello-world/juicer/MVN-INF/BUILD.pom)
- template: The pom uses a custom template [example](../examples/hello-world/healthyfoods/parentpom/MVN-INF/pom.template)
- skip: No pom is generated for this bazel package [see](../examples/skip-artifact-generation/README.md)

##### maven_artifact_update.version_increment_strategy

Controls how the version attribute is incremented, [see CI setup](ci.md).

#### Optional Attributes

#####  maven_artifact.change_detection

Controls whether change detection should be enabled for this artifact. If set to `False`, this artifact will always be marked as needing to be released (and a new pom will always be generated).

Default value: `True`

#####  maven_artifact.generate_dependency_management_pom

If set to `True`, a dependency management only pom is generated in addition to the usual pom [example](../examples/dependency-management).

Default value: `False`


### LIBRARY.root (required)

The LIBRARY.root file is a marker file that is currently empty.  It groups together multiple artifacts, defined by BUILD.pom files, into a single "library". All artifacts that belong to a single library are processed (installed/uploaded) together. Change detection also operates at the library level. If a single artifact in a library has changed, then all artifacts in the library are marked as needing to be released.

Whether an artifact belongs to a library is determined by directory structure: an artifact belongs to the LIBRARY.root found by walking up the file system from the artifact's BUILD.pom file.  For a multi-artifact library, the LIBRARY.root file lives in a parent directory, and multiple BUILD.pom files are defined below it, in subdirectories [example](../examples/hello-world/healthyfoods/MVN-INF/LIBRARY.root). If the library only consists of a single artifact, then the LIBRARY.root file should live next to the artifact's BUILD.pom file [example](../examples/hello-world/juicer/MVN-INF/LIBRARY.root).

:warning: LIBRARY.ROOT files cannot not be nested, ie libraries cannot be defined within other libraries.


### BUILD.pom.released (not user editable)

This file is used by pomgen to track whether an artifact has changed since it was last released [see CI setup](ci.md).


### pom.xml.released (not user editable)

This file is used by pomgen to track whether an artifact has changed since it was last released [see CI setup](ci.md).
