# Working across Bazel and Maven

Some users may need to work across Bazel and Maven projects. There are two common use cases:


## Use jars produced by Maven in a Bazel project

1. Copy or link the jar to same directory the BUILD file lives in (or a subdirectory)
1. Create a `java_import` rule that points to the jar
1. Replace the `maven_install` based dependency (starting with `@`) with the `java_import` target (starting with `//`)
1. Build as usual


### Example

Copy the jar.
```
cd $BUILD_DIR
cp ~/.m2/repository/org/slf4j/slf4j-api/1.7.29/slf4j-api-1.7.30-SNAPSHOT.jar .
```
Or symlink to it. The advantage of using a link is that the jar can be updated by Maven without having to re-copy it.
```
cd $BUILD_DIR
ln -s ~/.m2/repository/org/slf4j/slf4j-api/1.7.29/slf4j-api-1.7.30-SNAPSHOT.jar .
```
Create `java_import` rule in the BUILD file. In this example, we'll use slf4j-api. This assumes that the jar the  has been copied or symlinked to the same directory as the BUILD file.
```
java_import(
    name = "org_slf4j_slf4j_api",
    jars = [":slf4j-api-1.7.30-SNAPSHOT.jar"],
)
```
Then, in the deps attribute(s) replace the `maven_install` rule for slf4j-api with the `java_import` rule that was just created.
```
java_library(
    name = "fruit-api",
    srcs = glob(["src/main/java/**/*.java"]),
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    deps = [
      ...
      ":org_slf4j_slf4j_api", # instead of "@maven//:org_slf4j_slf4j_api"
      ...
    ],
)
```


## Build jars with Bazel and use them in a Maven project

Similar to above, we can build jars using Bazel, so that they can be used in Maven projects. See below for detailed steps.

1. Make code changes to the library which you want to release a jar for.
1. Build the library by running `bazel build path/to/library/...`.
1. Run `bazel run @pomgen//maven -- -a pomgen,install -l path/to/library` to generate poms and install the jars to `~/.m2/repository`.
1. Update the pom.xml in the consuming Maven project to use the right jar version


### Example

Make some code changes in `examples/hello-world/healthyfoods/fruit-api`.

Run bazel build.
```
bazel build //examples/hello-world/healthyfoods/...
```

Generate pom(s) and install artifacts into `~/.m2/repository`:
```
bazel run @pomgen//maven -- -a pomgen,install -l examples/hello-world/healthyfoods
```

Then, update the pom.xml of the consuming Maven project.
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.pomgen.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>fruit-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Now you can compile your Maven project, it will use the latest jars produced by Bazel.
