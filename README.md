## Overview

The set of scripts in this repository provides a solution for:
 - Generating pom.xml files for jars built by Bazel (typically ```java_library``` or ```java_binary``` rules)
 - Uploading the pom.xmls and jars to a Maven Artifact Repository such as Nexus (or installing them into the local Maven Repository at ~/.m2/repository)
  - Handling the grouping of related jars into a "library", similar to a multi-module Maven project: all jars that are part of the same library are uploaded together
  - Crawling library references and uploading those that have changed since they were last uploaded to Nexus

pomgen does not run as part of the Bazel build - therefore Bazel BUILD files can remain free of pom.xml related metadata.


## Usage Requirements

- External Maven Central/Nexus dependencies **must** be managed using [rules_jvm_external](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external)'s `maven_install` rule
- Artifacts **must** be [pinned](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external#pinning-artifacts-and-integration-with-bazels-downloader), because pomgen parses the pinned artifacts' json file(s)
  - The location of all pinned artifact json files must be declared in the pomgen [config file](#configuration) by setting `maven_install_paths`


### Compatibility

Pomgen uses the lockfiles generated by [rules_jvm_external](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external). Version 5.0 of rules_jvm_external included a new lockfile format. In October 2023, we [released pomgen 2.0.0](https://github.com/salesforce/pomgen/releases/tag/2.0.0) which uses the new lockfile format.

- pomgen < 2.0.0 is compatible with rules_jvm_external < 5.0
- pomgen >= 2.0.0 is compatible with rules_jvm_external >= 5.0


## Setup 101

 - Add a `java_library` rule that builds the jar, make it the [default target](https://bazel.build/concepts/labels) (or [configure](docs/mdfiles.md#maven_artifacttarget_name) the target name)
 - Add a [MVN-INF/BUILD.pom](examples/hello-world/healthyfoods/fruit-api/MVN-INF/BUILD.pom) file to define Maven specific metadata (artifactId etc)
 - Add a [MVN-INF/LIBRARY.root](examples/hello-world/healthyfoods/MVN-INF/LIBRARY.root) file to mark the Bazel Package as a library with a single jar artifact

See [this doc](docs/mdfiles.md) for more information on pomgen metadata files.


## Bazel Package References

The BUILD file of a Maven Artifact producing Bazel Package may obviously reference other Bazel Packages in the repository. pomgen will follow these references and generate pom.xml files for all referenced Bazel Packages. 


## Change Detection

pomgen tracks whether the content of a Bazel Package has changed since it was last released. Generated poms reference the previously released Maven Artifact if no change is detected.

See [this doc](docs/change_detection.md) for more information on change detection.


## Example

Please see the [hello-world example](examples/hello-world/README.md) to see how pomgen works.


## External Dependencies

- Bazel, ideally through [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk)
    - This branch has been tested with Bazel 7.x
- Python 3 is required and must be configured as a toolchain or available in your $PATH
- You need to install [lxml](https://lxml.de): pip install --user lxml


## Running pomgen in your own repository

Reference this repository in your `WORKSPACE` file using Bazel's `git_repository` rule:

```
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")

git_repository(
    name = "pomgen",
    remote = "https://github.com/salesforce/pomgen.git",
    commit = "<git-commit-sha>"
)
```

You can then run pomgen commands [as documented](examples/hello-world/README.md#before-running-pomgen), for example:

```
bazel run @pomgen//maven -- -a pomgen,install
```


## Configuration

Some pomgen behavior is driven by an optional configuration file `.pomgenrc`. pomgen looks for this file at the root of the repository it is running in.

Running pomgen with `--verbose` causes the current config to be echoed.

The file format is:

```
[general]
# Path to the pom template, used when generating pom.xml files for jar artifacts
# Default value: config/pom_template.xml
pom_template_path=

# The base filename (without extension) of the generated pom files.
# Default value: pom
pom_base_filename=

# The list of all maven install json files with pinned dependencies, comma-separated. 
# All dependencies that pomgen encounters in BUILD files must exist in one of the files
# listed here.
# Default value: maven_install.json
# Example value: tools/maven_install/*.json,another/path/to/mvn_install.json,
maven_install_paths=

# The list of all overridden deps bzl files, comma-separated.
# Default value: empty (not set)
override_file_paths=

[crawler]
# A list of path prefixes that are not crawled by pomgen.  Any source dependency
# that starts with one of the specified paths is skipped and not processed
# (and not included in the generated pom.xml).
# These dependencies are similar to Maven's "provided" scope: if they are
# needed at runtime, it is expected that the final runtime assembly
# contains them.
# Default value: []
# Example value: projects/protos/,
excluded_dependency_paths=

# A list of labels that are skipped over by pomgen.  Any dependency
# that matches one of the specified strings is skipped and not processed
# (and not included in the generated pom.xml).
# These dependencies are similar to Maven's "provided" scope: if they are
# needed at runtime, it is expected that the final runtime assembly
# contains them.
# Default value: []
# Example value: @maven//:com_google_guava_guava,
excluded_dependency_labels=


[artifact]
# Global toggle for change detection (docs/change_detection.md)
# Default value: True
change_detection_enabled=

# Paths not considered when determining whether an artifact has changed
# Default value: src/test,
excluded_relative_paths=

# File names not considered when determining whether an artifact has changed
# Default value: .gitignore,
excluded_filenames=

# Ignored file extensions when determining whether an artifact has changed
# Default value: .md,
excluded_extensions=

# Specifies how to increment the versions of libraries released transitively
# Default value: semver
# Possible values: semver|counter
transitives_versioning_mode=

# The classifier used for all jars artifacts assembled by pomgen
# The same value can also be specified by setting the environment variable
# POMGEN_JAR_CLASSIFIER - the environment variable takes precedence over the
# value set in this cfg file
# Default value: empty (not set)
jar_classifier=
```


### transitives_versioning_mode

Please see [more information about transitives versioning](docs/ci.md#using-a-different-version-increment-mode-for-transitives).


### override_file_paths

[rules_jvm_external](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external#overriding-generated-targets) allows to override dependencies at runtime. pomgen provides an equivalent override mechanism: use `override_file_paths` in the `[general]` section of .pomgenrc file. The value of `override_file_paths` is one or more paths (comma-separated) to .bzl files, containing a dependency -> overriden dependency mapping.

See [this example](examples/dep-overrides).
